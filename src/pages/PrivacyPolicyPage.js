            <li>Consumer Report Notice</li>
            <p>
              In some cases, insurance agents, insurers, and Insurance Services
              may need to obtain additional background information about you.
              For example, consumer reports (including credit reports) may be
              ordered in connection with your insurance application. These
              reports provide information that may assist in determining your
              eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged.
              Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewals, or
              extensions of insurance. Insurance companies may also obtain and
              use a credit-based insurance score based on information contained
              in your consumer report. Insurance agents, insurers, and Insurance
              Services may use a third-party service provider in connection with
              the development of your insurance score and rate quote. By
              providing information to us for use in obtaining an insurance
              quote, you give your express consent for insurance agents,
              Insurers, Insurance Services, and associated third-party service
              providers with whom we share your Personal Information to obtain
              and use a consumer report as described in this paragraph.

                Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of
                the Site or Services as well as other websites and services.
                These companies may use cookies and other online tracking

                Information as part of our online behavioral advertising

              <li>Information from Advertisements and Insurance Services</li>
              <p>
                If you arrive at the Site via an advertisement (e.g., banner ad)
                or an Insurance Service, we may collect information regarding
                the advertisement or Insurance Service with which you interacted

              <li>Tracking Pixels and Clear GIFs</li>
              <p>
                We employ software technology that enables us to track certain
                aspects of a user's visit to the Site. This technology helps us
                better manage content on the Site by informing us what content
                is effective, how consumers engage with the Site, and how
                consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Site. The software
                typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) "tracking
                pixels" and (2) "clear gifs." Tracking pixels are pieces of
                executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage
                activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed,
                and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics
                with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and
                email messages that track whether or not a user has viewed a
                particular web page or email message. User activity information
                may be associated with additional information about a user's
                session, such as IP addresses and the type of browser used, and
                Personal Information, if provided by the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another
                website, then certain information about you that you provided to
                that other website, such as the terms you were searching that
                led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it.
                You should review the privacy policy of any website from which
                you reached the Site to determine what information was collected
                by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website
                could use that information. We may retain information about you
                provided to us by other websites, and will only use it in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy. Such information may be
                associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.
